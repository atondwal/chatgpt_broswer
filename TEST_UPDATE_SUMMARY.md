# Test Update Summary

## Changes Made to Test Files

### Overview
Updated test files to work with the simplified `enhanced_tui.py` which removed the following classes:
- `ConversationListView`
- `TreeView`
- `WindowDimensions`
- All inheritance from `NavigableListView` and `BaseView`

### Files Modified

#### 1. `tests/test_functionality.py`
- **Import Changes**: Updated imports to only import `ChatGPTTUI` and `ViewMode` from enhanced_tui
- **Test 3 Rewrite**: Replaced the view component tests (which tested removed classes) with simpler tests that:
  - Check the current view mode
  - List available view modes
  - Verify conversations are loaded
  - Confirm organizer integration

#### 2. `tests/test_advanced_edge_cases.py`
- **Import Changes**: Added `ViewMode` to imports from enhanced_tui
- **UI Edge Cases Test**: Simplified the test to:
  - Test TUI initialization without requiring curses
  - Verify all core components are initialized (conversations, organizer)
  - Check initial view mode is LIST
  - Ensure the TUI is in running state

### Results
- All 24 tests pass successfully
- Tests now focus on functionality rather than internal class structure
- Removed dependencies on classes that no longer exist
- Tests are simpler and more maintainable

### Key Benefits
1. Tests are aligned with the simplified architecture
2. Focus on testing actual functionality vs implementation details
3. No more mock curses components for testing views
4. Tests run faster and are more reliable
